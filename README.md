# FYS-STK4155 - Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning 

This repository contains projects for Machine Learning Course taken at the University of Oslo.

## Project 1:

In this project, I performed _Linear Regression_ and its variations (_Ridge_, _Lasso_) on the Franke function and terrain data.

All files, codes and the pdf of the report can be found inside "p1" folder. 


## Project 2:

In this project, I try to predict the probability of default from credit card data using _Logistic Regression_ and _Feed Forward Neural Network_ developed from scratch.

All files, codes and the pdf of the report can be found inside "p2" folder. 

## Project 3:

In this project, we performed the analysis of the microbial ecology data set comprised of 72 observations and 15000 predictors using _Random Forests_, _XGboost_, _Siamese_ and _Feed-Forward Neural Networks_, where the combination of `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`/`Keras` and the codes developed during first two projects were used for performance comparisons.

**Note**: Third project was a team effort performed by Laurent Fontaine, Maziar Kosarifar, Maksym Brilenkov and Knut Hauge Engvik. The files in this repository was/is a backup in case of "something went wrong". If you want to check the actual report, please see this repository instead:
